# Turret
Simple pan/tilt mechanism to explore trajectory planning

This repo includes a generic trajectory planner in trajectoryPlanner.py. The planner supports cubic and quintic path interpolation.

turret.py is a script that uses the trajectory planner and some supporting code to drive stepper motors with a Raspberry Pi.
